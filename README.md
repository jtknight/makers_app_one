This is a sample application, building more skills in Ruby on Rails for a new Makers Atlas website.

The desired functionality is:

- View an index list of all the Brands
- Click on a brand in the index list and be taken to their individual page with full details about the brand.
- View videos (YouTube and Vimeo) related to each brand
- View a Google Map with location of each Brand
- View Twitter and Instagram feeds
- Make all brand information fully editable.
- Upload a brand logo
- Have an "Admin" class of users that can edit and delete brands.
